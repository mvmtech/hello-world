Chrome Raspberry Android smoothie

My naame is Marvin. I like tinkering with Rasberry devices and I love to help with creating a stable robust version of Android or Chrome OS for the Raspberry Pi. I'm a very knowledgable with hardwares, but a beginner when it comes to coding. I've been trying to get back into coding, like C++, java and python with a side SQL but lacking challenges. So any and all suggestions are greatly appreiciated.
